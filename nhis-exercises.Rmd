```

### Load the prepared NHIS sample

```{r, eval = FALSE}
load("nhis-covid.Rdata")
```

For our class, we will only select a few variables. I have prepared a dataset that we'll be using. The code below shows the steps involved.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nhis <- df %>%
  mutate(REGION = as_factor(REGION),
         SEX = as_factor(SEX),
         EDUC = as_factor(EDUC),
         HEALTH = as_factor(HEALTH),
         HINOTCOVE = as_factor(HINOTCOVE),
         DEPFEELEVL = as_factor(DEPFEELEVL),
         CVDSYMP = as_factor(CVDSYMP)
  ) %>%
  select(YEAR, REGION, AGE, SEX, EDUC, HEALTH, HINOTCOVE, DEPFEELEVL, CVDSYMP, PERWEIGHT)

save(nhis, file="nhis-example.Rdata")
```

The data file `nhis-example.Rdata` is available on Brightspace. Download it now, then
create a new project in RStudio and load it as follows:

```{r}
load("original-data/nhis-example.Rdata")
View(nhis)
```

```

### Exercise
- Got to the IPUMS Health Surveys web site - https://healthsurveys.ipums.org/
- Choose Get Data under National Health Interview Surveys
- On the next page, look for Create an Extract and click Get Data
- Using the menus under Select Variables to find the variable  CVDSYMP

### Run tabulation on COVID symptom response
```{r}
t1 <- nhis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2020) %>%
  tabyl(CVDSYMP)

t1
```

```{r}
t1 %>%
  adorn_totals("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting()

```

```{r}
t2 <- nhis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2020) %>%
  tabyl(REGION, CVDSYMP) 
t2
```

```{r}
t2 %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 2)
```
